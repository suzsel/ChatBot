Alternative media is defined as media that uses an electronic device to store or retrieve the information that pertains to the trust account and transaction documentation. This requirement applies to any computer technology utilized by the broker to create, store or retrieve the aforementioned documentation, whether the computerized device is internal or external to the broker's computer equipment. If a broker utilizes his own equipment or a third party vendor to create, store or retrieve this information, the broker shall ensure that the documentation is maintained and able to be retrieved for the five (5) year time period as required by the Commission.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(1)  Trust account records shall be maintained by the broker in their original format for a minimum of two (2) years. Trust account records may then be transferred to an alternative media for the remaining required record retention time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(2)  Records, with the exception of trust account records, may be transferred at any time to an alternative media for the remaining required retention time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(3)  After documents are converted to alternative media, a quality assurance check shall be done to ensure that every document was imaged and can be reproduced in a legible and readable condition on a display device.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(4)  After the quality assurance check is completed, the original documents may be destroyed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(5)  A broker shall maintain the alternative media and a means of viewing and retrieving records, and shall provide a true, correct and legible paper copy to the Commission upon request.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(6)  A broker shall store copies of the alternative media and the equipment used to read the media in an environment and at a level of quality conducive to maintain the ability to reproduce the media throughout the retention period. Reproduce means a process in which a document can be converted from the alternative media to a paper copy that is legible and able to be read.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(n) <strong>Cessation of real estate activities.</strong> Upon a firm ceasing a portion of real estate activities or ceasing all real estate activities the broker shall:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(1)  Notify the Commission in writing of the effective date of such action and advise as to the location where records will be stored and comply with the following:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(A)  Return the broker's license certificate and pocket identification card and all license certificates of those associated with the broker to the Commission and advise the Commission as to the circumstances involving any not returned.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(B)  Release forms must be filed for all licensees affiliated with the firm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(C)  The broker must either transfer to a new firm or place his or her license on inactive status.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(2)  Notify in writing all listing and management clients, as well as parties and co-brokers to existing contracts advising them of the date of cessation of real estate activities.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(3)  All advertising in the name of the firm must be terminated and offering signs removed within thirty (30) days of cessation of real estate activities.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(4)  Funds in trust accounts and pending contracts must be maintained by the responsible broker until consummation of transaction and final proper disbursal of funds. Upon final disbursements of funds the broker is required to close the account and notify the Commission in writing that the account is closed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(5)  In the event the responsible broker is unable to continue to maintain the funds and/or pending contracts, funds and/or pending contracts may be transferred to another authorized broker, entity or legal representative until consummation and proper disbursal of funds. In this event, the broker must submit a request in writing to the Commission for approval to transfer the contracts and/or funds. Upon written approval by the Commission, the broker must secure approval and obtain new agreements from all parties for transfer of the contracts and/or funds.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(6)  If funds, items and/or contracts are transferred to another authorized broker, entity or legal representative and approved by the Commission, the broker transferring such shall be required to compile a record of the following, retain a copy for his or her file and give a copy to the receiving authorized broker, entity or legal representative:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(A)  A copy of the written approval from the Commission authorizing the transfer of the contracts and/or funds.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(B)  The name and address of the authorized broker, entity or legal representative.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(C)  A trust account reconciliation sheet indicating ledger balance and financial institution balance at time of transfer to include the name of each depositor, amount of deposit, date, and purpose of the deposit.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(D)  A statement indicating that written agreements were obtained from all parties to each transaction agreeing to the transfer of the funds and/or contracts to another responsible broker, authorized entity or legal representative and that each depositor was notified of the effective date of transfer, and the name of the responsible person or entity.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(7)  Any firm merger shall have a thirty (30) day time period in which to provide the Commission the documentation as referenced in subparagraph (n) of this rule. Firm merger means that a licensed firm has been acquired by another licensed firm and the firm that was acquired is ceasing a portion or all of its licensed activities.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(o) <strong>Security breach of personal information.</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(1)  Security breach of personal information as defined in Title 24, Oklahoma Statutes, Sections 161-166 means the unauthorized access and acquisition of unencrypted and unredacted computerized data that compromises the security or confidentiality of personal information maintained by a licensee as part of a database of personal information regarding multiple persons. Personal information means the first name or first initial and last name in combination with and linked to any one or more of the following data elements:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(A)  social security number,</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(B)  driver license number or state identification card number issued in lieu of a driver license, or</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-2\">(C)  financial account number, or credit card or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to the financial accounts.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(2)  The breach of information would not include information that is lawfully obtained from publicly available information, or from federal, state or local government records lawfully made available to the general public.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify ql-indent-1\">(3)  In the event personal information is breached, the licensee is required to send notice to the Commission and to all concerned persons whose information was breached by an unauthorized person or source as required in Title 24, O.S., Section 162 .
