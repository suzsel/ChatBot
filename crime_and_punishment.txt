Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a student oppressed by poverty and weighed down by the harsh realities of life, becomes consumed with thoughts about the meaning of existence and the boundaries of morality. He formulates a theory of the "right of the strong," dividing people into "trembling creatures" and those who "have the right." According to his reasoning, the "rightful ones" are those who can transcend conventional moral norms for the sake of a higher purpose.

Testing his theory in practice, Raskolnikov resolves to murder an old pawnbroker, whom he considers "superfluous" and "harmful" to society. However, the crime brings him neither relief nor self-affirmation. Instead, he is overwhelmed by fear, alienation, and an intense inner conflict. He begins to imagine evidence everywhere, and his suspicious behavior attracts the attention of investigator Porfiry Petrovich, who skillfully plays a psychological game with the protagonist.

Amid the crime, the story of Sonia Marmeladova unfolds — a young woman forced to make sacrifices to save her family. Sonia serves as Raskolnikov’s moral antithesis: she embodies love, humility, and a willingness to endure suffering. Through Sonia, Raskolnikov gains the chance for genuine repentance. Her faith in God and her selfless devotion awaken in him the human emotions he has tried to suppress.

Symbolically, the events take place in St. Petersburg — a city depicted by Dostoevsky as dark and suffocating, reflecting the characters' tormented states of mind. Cramped rooms, gray streets, and the city’s constant noise create an atmosphere of despair and inner crisis.

Gradually, Raskolnikov realizes that his theory does not hold up in reality. He is not one of the "rightful ones" but an ordinary person who could not silence his conscience. His punishment comes not from the law but from his own guilt and torment. The path to spiritual redemption begins when he confesses his crime and accepts his punishment. Through the love and faith that Sonia offers, he finds his way to redemption and renewal.

Thus, the novel Crime and Punishment raises fundamental questions of morality, responsibility, and the road to atonement. It portrays the tragedy of a man who sought to step beyond universal moral norms but ultimately could not bear the weight of his actions.
